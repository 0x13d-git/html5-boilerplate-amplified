# html5-boilerplate-amplified
HTML5 Boilerplate + AmplifyJS + Copper Components

## Abstract

We taken the best of web development best practices to provide a AWS Amplify Boilerplate that accomplishes the following:
* No build Steps.
* As few opinions as possible.
* Painless AWS integration.
* Open Source license.

## Problem Statement

* Getting started in modern front end dev is difficult
* Dependency management of NPM packages is difficult
* NPM build chains are insecure by default and require active patching and forced upgrades to ensure that package drift doesn't increase tech debt.

## Quick Start

1. Load the `index.html` file in a browser.

## Roadmap

## Influences

* HTML5 Boilerplate [^1]: Represents our default `index.html` container.
* Amplify JS [^2][^3][^4]: AWS Fullstack SDK
* Redux [^5]: State container
* Polymer [^6]: The web components library used by copper-components.
